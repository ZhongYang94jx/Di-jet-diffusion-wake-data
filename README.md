(1) These files are data points shown in arXiv:2501.03419. The name of file indicates the figure we plot in the manuscript. 
(2) The raw pp dataset is from PYTHIA model, which is public. Therefore, people can get it by running the PYTHIA directly.
(3) The raw Pb+Pb dataset is generated by our CoLBT-hydro model. It is not publicly available upon publication because it is not technically feasible and/or the cost of preparing, depositing, and hosting the data would be prohibitive within the terms of this research project. The data are available from the authors upon reasonable request. (You can connect Zhong Yang and Xin-Nian Wang directly)
(4) For Fig.1, it is just the illustrated figure. Therefore, we don't provide the data point.
(5) For Fig.2, it is the 2D distribution, we already show the range of x and y in the dataset. People should use x and y information to form the 2D matrix. And then get the distriution as we show in the manuscript.
(6) For Fig.3 and 4, the file not only includes the x,y value, it also includes the error bar in x and y ranges. The plot in these figure is the band between y+yerr, y-yerr.
